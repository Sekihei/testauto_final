Instructions
You should share your repository with me (Remember to make it public)

Your repository should contain:

A pipeline which is running the tests.

Five tests for the page: hoff.is/login


You need to use PageObject models for the tests.


For the five tests, these are the rules:

At least one test needs to make a purchase.

At least one test needs to be using the API

At least one test needs to be accessibility testing.

This isn’t something I’ve taught you, you will need to use playwright documentation or ChatGPT to do it.



For the API, the following endpoints can be used:
https://hoff.is/store2/api/v1/price/1 .. this will show you one products details (you can set it to any product ID between 1-10.)

https://hoff.is/store2/api/v1/product/list .. this will show you all products that exists on the page.
